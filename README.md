# UseCallback 

Call useCallback at the top level of your component to cache a function definition between re-renders

# UseState: 
initialState: The value you want the state to be initially. It can be a value of any type, but there is a special behavior for functions. This argument is ignored after the initial render.
If you pass a function as initialState, it will be treated as an initializer function. It should be pure, should take no arguments, and should return a value of any type. React will call your initializer function when initializing the component, and store its return value as the initial state.

# UseEffect

# Boostrap
Navbars require a wrapping .navbar with .navbar-expand{-sm|-md|-lg|-xl} for responsive collapsing and color scheme classes.
Navbars and their contents are fluid by default. Use optional containers to limit their horizontal width.

# Next.js 

Routing	A file-system based router built on top of Server Components that supports layouts, nested routing, loading states, error handling, and more.
Rendering	Client-side and Server-side Rendering with Client and Server Components. Further optimized with Static and Dynamic Rendering on the server with Next.js. Streaming on Edge and Node.js runtimes.
